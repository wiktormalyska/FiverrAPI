# FiverrAPI

## Project for web scraping Fiverr profiles

### 3rd party libs used:
- [x] [JSoup](https://jsoup.org/)
- [x] [JUnit](https://junit.org/junit5/)
- [x] [Lombok](https://projectlombok.org/)

#### Why package name is so long?
- GitHub actions has some weird kind of bug, where you cannot deploy a package with the same artifact name as someone's package

# Project is still in progress...
